# Toolset plugin notes



- WP have virtually no datatypes; have to use a plugin.  I settled on using Toolset, which is a suite of tools we need:
  - custom types
  - custom post types
  - data-driven Views (e.g., view single and lists of custom post types)

# Types

# Import

# Export



- Toolset exports types in XML

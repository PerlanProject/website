I created this dir so the PODS code for Perlan could be backed up and versioned via git.  

NOTE that this data has to actually live in the WordPress database as part of the PODS configuration.

For example, the Templates are normally created and accessed via:

	WordPress dashboard | Pods Admin | Pod Templates

and fwiw they are stored in wp_posts as post_type "_pods_template".


-- jdm
